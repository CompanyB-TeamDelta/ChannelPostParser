Program is designed so, that you can easily expand it with new services for 
fetching posts like Twitter, Whats up etc.
Moreover you can choose which service to fetch posts from in config.py 
(SERVICE_NAME).

In this file is explained how to extend program with new services for fetching.
Let`s suppose we want to add Twitter to our service:

1. Go in src/fetchers and create file for new service: TwitterFetcher.py

2. In file TwitterFetcher.py do import:
	from src.fetchers.FetcherInterface import FetcherInterface

3. Create in TwitterFetcher.py class TwitterFetcher(FetcherInterface), 
	which inherits from FetcherInterface

4. Implement all inherited from FetcherInterface methods in TwitterFetcher.py:
	get_last_post,
	get_last_n_posts,
	get_posts_by_date_range, get_posts_by_date,
	get_post_by_id

5. Also in TwitterFetcher class add static variable:
	service_name = "twitter"
   in order this fetcher could be turned on/off from config.py

6. Go to src/entrypoints/PostsFetcher.py and find function get_posts_fetcher()

7. In get_posts_fetcher add:
    elif SERVICE_NAME == "twitter": # should be the same as service_name
        fetcher = TwitterFetcher()
    * also do not forget to import TwitterFetcher from TwitterFetcher.py

8. Go in config.py and add:
	SERVICE_NAME = "twitter"

9. Now our program will fetch data from twitter.
