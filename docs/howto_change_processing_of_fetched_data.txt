Program is designed so, that you can easily change the way fetched data is
being process (should it be saved locally in json or loaded to ftp server or
other ways)
Moreover you can choose which data_processor to user from in config.py 
(DATA_PROCESSOR).

In this file is explained how to change the way of how data will be processed 
after being fetched:

1. Go to src/data_processors/data_processors.py.

2. Define function for processing data. Use the following interface: 
	def my_custom_data_processing(channel: Channel)

3. Implement my_custom_data_processing.
	def my_custom_data_processing(channel: Channel):
		...send_data_to_some_other_server(channel)

4. In data_processors.py find function get_data_processor.

5. Add if clause for my_custom_data_processing in get_data_processor:
	if DATA_PROCESSOR == "best_data_processor":
		return my_custom_data_processing

6. Go in config.py and add
	DATA_PROCESSOR = "best_data_processor"

7. Now after data fetched from service my_custom_data_processing will be 
	called. The responsibility of calling my_custom_data_processing is on
	src/fetchers/*Fetcher.py classes. Fetchers define, when 
	my_custom_data_processing should be called. In my_custom_data_processing
	we just get Channel and it`s posts.
